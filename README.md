### Installation

You can install this library with composer.

```bash
composer require td512/cpanel-whm-api:dev-master
```

### Usage
```php
<?php
require "vendor/autoload.php";

//Build WHM Client
use PreviewTechs\cPanelWHM\WHM\Accounts;
use PreviewTechs\cPanelWHM\WHMClient;

require "vendor/autoload.php";
$whmClient = new WHMClient("WHM_USERNAME","API_TOKEN", "yourwhmserver.com", 2087);
$accounts = new Accounts($whmClient);

var_dump($accounts->searchAccounts());
```

#### WHM Client

To access and use WHM related functionality you must need to build WHM client with configuration
and credentials.

To configure your WHM client, you must provide your WHM username (you use to login into your WHM panel) and API Token. 

If you have an API token you can use that if proper permissions are configured, otherwise
you can create a new API token from your WHM.

Create API token from https://your-whm-server:2087/cpsessxxxxxx/scripts7/apitokens/home

Learn more about WHM API Token from [https://documentation.cpanel.net/display/64Docs/Manage+API+Tokens](https://documentation.cpanel.net/display/64Docs/Manage+API+Tokens)
```php
<?php
use PreviewTechs\cPanelWHM\WHMClient;
